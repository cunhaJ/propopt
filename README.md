# propopt

Propopt is a Python library to compute light propagation for wave optics.

It provides implementation of scalar propagation algorithms for different purposes (applications for diffractive optical elements and lenses), all within the same package. Implemented algorithms:  
* Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Integral  
* Fresnel Approximation 
* Fraunhofer Approximation
